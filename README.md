## Project information
```
We have implemented Vue as our frontend, and firebase is our database.  We have not implemeted a RESTish backend

In our database, we have tables for host, patrons, and rooms.  You are able to put a room into the database, and you are able to see what the different patrons and hosts.

The *list files are the
views that shows display either host, patron, or room.

The RESTish backend would run through another server, but we have not had time to implement it.
We plan to follow this link during project term to implement a RESTish backend https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/use-rest-api
